# Ultra Super Calculation Computer

## Instructions
This code will mimic the code for the CPU that will support calculation functions for an ISA.

The Five Functions Supported:
* Add
* Subtract
* Multiply
* Divide
* Display a history of calculations

These five functions also use several other support functions so that we can access different parts of our computer hardware. This script will also be able to:
* Read and split up incoming data
* Store a binary number to a register
* Access what is stored in the register
* Allocate some registers for a 'history' of our calculations
* Store/Load from the history when needed
